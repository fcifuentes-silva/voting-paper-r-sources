# Describing the nature of legislation through roll call voting in the Chilean National Congress, a linked dataset description: R sources

Here you will find a set of R sources for processing roll call voting data from a SPARQL endpoint (http://datos.bcn.cl/sparql), and to transform the selected data into charts.

I recommend to use RStudio https://rstudio.com/ for compiling and to process the data.
